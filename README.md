The questions I analyzed using the yearly sales dataset:
1.	Which month demonstrated the highest sales performance, and what was the total revenue generated during that period?
2.	Which city contributed the most to overall sales throughout the year?
3.	At what time of day should advertisements be strategically displayed to maximize customer engagement and purchasing likelihood?
4.	Which combinations of products are most frequently purchased together by customers?
5.	Which product achieved the highest overall sales volume during the year?
